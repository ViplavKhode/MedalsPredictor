# Medals Predictor Overview
This is a beginner machine learning project which includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error. The aim of building this project was to understand how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter.
I have used data from historical Olympic games and tried to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

# Project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which I have also follow here.  This outline will help you tackle any machine learning problem.

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.
